                  <p>I have been programming since the beginning of the 7th grade of primary school. The first programming language was obviously html to understand the basics and find out what programming really is. Later I thought it would be worth learning how to program in python and at that time a free course from SAP was available. After completing this course, I got a certificate click <a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/python1/certificate" target="_blank">here</a> to see it. I am currently learning JavaScript because it is one of the most popular languages today and without knowledge of this language it will be hard for me to continue my programming profession.</p>

                  <p>I have been doing sports since childhood. I like martial arts. At the age of six, I started practicing a type of kung fu called wushu. After some time I moved from this sport and thought about moai tai. I started doing this sport in 2017 and continue trainging till this days, but sometimes I take breaks due to health problems. But my favorite is calestethics, because with its help I feel my body and know what I can do. It helps me to be flexible and durable.</p>

                  <p>The cello is an instrument that has already become a part of my personality, I cannot imagine my life without the cello. I played in an orchestra, in a string band, in a rock band. I started playing the cello at the age of 7. But the cello was not my first and final decision. As the first instrument, I wanted to learn to play was violin, but I failed because I have physiological problem with my left hand, so I could not play this instrument. The cello is an instrument I play both classical and rock. This instrument has no limits in its sound and the things that can be played on it.</p>

                  <p>Singing has been my passion for about 3 years. In the beginning, I sang songs that just caught my ear and that was it. But now I sing songs in many languages such as Polish, Belarusian, Russian and English. I live in poland about five years but it is really tricky for me to find Polish song that would suit me. I sing in the Belarusian choir shown in the picture. Mostly I sing songs in the style of alternative metal or classical. Singing has stretched my voice and made my mutation less noticeable.</p>

                  <p>I honestly do not like playing games because I get bored very quickly. The game that is shown in the picture completely changed my mind. Omori showed that games can have such a gameplay which can make you cry. The game is about a teenager who lost his own sister and is in deep depression. The only place he can rest is in his own dream because in it he turns into his own alter ego named Omori. This web page is made almost entirely in the style of this game.</p>

                  <p>Music is a very important part of my life. The first thing I started listening to was the songs my sister downloaded to my phone when I was in first grade. After a while, I started choosing music on my own. My first choice was rap (not a great choice). After some time I found out about the existence of such a style as Rock. I have been listening to it for the last 7 years and I could not get enough of finding my style. But seven months ago I tried to listen to metal. Metal began to act on me like a drug. I searched for more bands, types and styles until I found a style that really suits me. It is funk metal. It is a combination of ancient instruments and choir vocals with alternative metal.</p>
